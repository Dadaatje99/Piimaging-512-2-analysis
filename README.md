For my master thesis, I worked with a SPAD512^2 detector from Pi Imaging, developing code to detect and analyze nanoparticles. 
This included creating intensity traces and fluorescence decay traces.

To use the code, you first need to download SEP_D, which contains essential functions for particle detection. 
This code is heavily inspired by Source Extraction and Photometry, hence the name SEP_D [adaatje99].

Please note that this project is still in the early stages and is a work in progress.
